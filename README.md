#  Java Recursion Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice of **Recursion in Java**.  
I solved 20+ problems to build strong understanding of recursive thinking, base cases, and problem decomposition.

---

## Topics Covered

- What is Recursion
- Base Case & Recursive Case
- Stack Behavior in Recursion
- Tail vs Non-Tail Recursion
- Backtracking Basics
- Divide & Conquer Concepts

---

#Problems Implemented

###  Basic Recursion
- Factorial of a number
- Fibonacci series
- Sum of N natural numbers
- Power calculation (xⁿ)
- Print numbers from 1 to N
- Reverse a number

### Intermediate Problems
- Check palindrome (string/number)
- Sum of digits
- Count digits
- Binary search using recursion
- Tower of Hanoi
- GCD using recursion

###  Advanced / Interview Style
- Subsequence generation
- Permutations of a string
- N-Queens (if included)
- Backtracking examples
- Maze path problems
